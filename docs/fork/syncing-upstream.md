# Syncing with upstream

Ghia takes commits from gpuix and zed one at a time. There is no mirror branch and no rebase: `main` and zed `poc` only
grow (see [Repos and branches](working-on-the-fork.md#repos-and-branches)), and a ledger below records how far each upstream
has been reviewed.

- gpuix upstream is `upstream/main` (`remorses/gpuix`).
- zed upstream is `upstream/gpuix` (`remorses/zed`), in the `zed/` submodule.

## Ledger

Reviewed through, one SHA per repo. A commit at or before the SHA was taken, adapted or skipped. The start values are the
merge bases of the fork and upstream when the ledger began.

| Repo | Reviewed through |
|---|---|
| gpuix (`upstream/main`) | `515df198fef2685f5ed7dd120bf0db638eb5c360` |
| zed (`upstream/gpuix`) | `2565b8a3e33537c3d3f56d0d45f11e50a17e512d` |

Skips worth remembering, with the reason (a commit that looks wanted but breaks something):

- none yet

## Engine patches we carry

The `zed/` fork changes GPUI only for what Ghia needs (DOM semantics, composing with native views, retention, things Ghia
cannot do without); the engine otherwise stays as upstream ships it, and upstream picks go in as upstream wrote them (see
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) step 3 of "Do not invent behaviour on top of GPUI"). Any other engine change
needs the owner's explicit permission and an entry here: the decision, the considerations and the reasoning. A sync keeps
each entry or applies it again.

### Atlas tile sizing (zed `13f5c1d1b7`, `gpui_apple/src/metal_atlas.rs`)

- **Decision.** A tile wider or taller than 512 px (`DEDICATED_TEXTURE_THRESHOLD`) gets an atlas texture of exactly its
  size, clamped to 16384. Smaller tiles stay in the shared 1024 x 1024 textures. The owner chose to carry this as a
  fork patch, not to send it upstream.
- **Considerations.** Upstream GPUI sizes every new atlas texture to `max(request, 1024 x 1024)`, so a tile over 512 px
  gets a padded 1024 x 1024 texture that no second tile of its size can share. The patch is a general engine change, which
  the rule above allows only by permission. A dedicated texture goes through the existing remove path (its last tile frees
  the slot), and allocation still tries the existing textures first. The patch lives in `push_texture`, so a pick that
  touches it, or a sync that replaces `metal_atlas.rs`, has to keep the threshold; the tests
  `test_large_tile_gets_a_texture_of_its_own_size` and its neighbours in `metal_atlas.rs` fail when it is lost.
- **Reasoning.** The Apple Music clone's 15 album covers (about 600 x 600) took 60.5 MB of IOAccelerator for 21.6 MB of
  pixels; with the patch IOAccelerator went from 73.7 to 30.9 MB, 43 MB off an app of about 260 MB
  ([round 49](frames-and-wakes.md#where-an-apps-memory-goes-round-49)). The cost is a texture per large tile instead of
  sharing, which only matters for many large tiles of different sizes.

## Procedure

1. Fetch both upstreams: `git fetch upstream` in the repo root and in `zed/`.
2. List what is new, oldest first: `git log --reverse <ledger>..upstream/main`, and the same in `zed/` against
   `upstream/gpuix`.
3. Decide per commit: **take** it, **adapt** it, or **skip** it.
   - Take with `git cherry-pick -x`, so `git log --grep 'cherry picked from'` finds what came from upstream.
   - Adapt when the pick conflicts or does not fit; the invariants to keep are the conflict notes in
     [working-on-the-fork.md](working-on-the-fork.md#resolving-conflicts).
   - Skip release and version commits, Windows-only and Linux-only work, paths the fork removed, and anything against the
     DOM-semantics principle in [index.md](index.md#the-principle-dom-and-css-semantics). Fixes and additions the fork
     deems fit are taken.
4. Run the suites ([testing.md](testing.md)).
5. Advance the ledger in its own commit. A skip worth remembering is a line under "Skips" with its reason.

A picked commit has upstream's npm scope rewritten to `@ghia`, because the packages are published under it. The script
is in the body of the commit "The npm scope is @ghia".

A zed pick goes to zed `poc` first and is pushed; then a gpuix commit bumps the `zed` gitlink.
